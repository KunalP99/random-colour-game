# Guess the Hex
A simple game in which a random colour is presented to you, and you have to choose the correct answer from 3 possible answers. Once a correct answer is clicked, you will earn a point and a new colour will be displayed on screen. This mini project was to test my React and JavaScript skills and to give myself a challenge to solve.
